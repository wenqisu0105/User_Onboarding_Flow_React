# Proposal for Capturing User Data During Onboarding

In order to capture user data during the onboarding process at any time and under all circumstances, I propose a careful examination of the following aspects for the front-end.

## Assumptions
1. The database schema has been updated to accommodate incomplete form data, with new fields added to store intermediate form states (e.g., user interaction, timestamps, etc.).
2. The backend should have fallback options to convert partial data into a storable format.
3. The backend should be able to save and retrieve partial form data.
4. The backend should have implemented logic to resolve conflicting data in case multiple sources (with the same email) try to update the data simultaneously.
5. The feature complies with legal regulations regarding data retention.

## Frontend Changes

### Data Collection
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement event listeners on form fields to detect when, how, and what the user is doing with form elements. For example, we can keep track of key presses or focus events and trigger real-time saving of the data.
- **Saving Mechanism:** With a flexible database schema and an endpoint to accept partial data, we can send the data detected through real-time monitoring to the backend for saving.
- **Intermediate State Storage/Fetch:** Given that we have a backend (as assumed) where we can fetch incomplete data, we could enhance the filling process by loading that data from the backend, allowing the user to continue working on the form when they return.
- **Session Persistence:** Although we already have real-time data saving, we can use cookies or other client-side technologies to maintain the user's progress across browser crashes or short-term connectivity issues, enhancing the user experience.

### UI
- **Prompt on Exit:** We can add a prompt when users attempt to close the tab or navigate away, reminding them that their work will be saved and they can continue later.
- **Feedback on Auto-Save:** We can provide cues to inform users that their data has been saved automatically, enhancing user confidence.

## Conclusion

With the backend handling the complexities of data storage, conflict resolution, and legal compliance, the frontend can focus on real-time data handling, UI improvement, and synchronization with the backend. Existing tests should be updated, and new ones should be added to cover changes related to handling partial form data. Together, we can capture and analyze partial form data, gaining valuable insights and improving the user experience.
